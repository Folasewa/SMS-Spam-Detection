# SMS-Spam-Detection
This project is about creating a predictive model using SVM to classify sms as spam or ham
Key points to note concerning this project:
The data cleaning process is a little different from the regular data cleaning as a result of the dataset being a textual data.
Text normalization procedures were used as a guide for the data cleaning process.
A wordcloud was created by extractng thetext, generating the text and displaying the cloud in an email picture.
For the visualization aspect, seaborn was used to display a countplot of the spam against ham.
The Model building aspect involved vectorizing the text and selecting a suitable classifier.
A confusion matrix was displayed to get an overview of the predictive model.
